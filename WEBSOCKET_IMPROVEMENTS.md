# WebSocket Connection Improvements Summary

## Problem
Your WebSocket connection was closing after a short period of time, likely due to:
1. Missing keep-alive mechanism (heartbeat)
2. No reconnection logic
3. Poor error handling and debugging

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Keep-Alive Heartbeat
- Added automatic heartbeat every 30 seconds using `getSlot` RPC call
- Prevents idle connection timeouts
- Lightweight method that's universally supported

### 2. Automatic Reconnection
- Exponential backoff strategy (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- Maximum of 5 reconnection attempts
- Only reconnects on abnormal closures (not intentional disconnects)
- Tracks connection duration to identify server issues

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Separate error states for WebSocket vs store errors
- Proper handling of different RPC response types
- Improved logging with connection duration tracking
- Close code analysis for better debugging

### 4. Connection State Management
- Connection start time tracking
- Reconnection attempt counting
- Proper cleanup of timers and intervals
- State preservation during reconnections

### 5. Monitoring and Debugging
- Added WebSocket monitor utility for connection statistics
- Close code meanings reference
- Connection duration tracking
- Success rate calculation

## Key Code Changes

### TokenBalanceStore Interface
```typescript
interface TokenBalanceStoreState {
  // ... existing properties
  pingInterval: NodeJS.Timeout | null;
  reconnectTimeout: NodeJS.Timeout | null;
  reconnectAttempts: number;
  connectionStartTime: number | null;
  
  // New methods
  _setupHeartbeat: () => void;
  _clearHeartbeat: () => void;
  _scheduleReconnect: (walletPublicKey: PublicKey) => void;
  _clearReconnect: () => void;
}
```

### Heartbeat Implementation
```typescript
_setupHeartbeat: () => {
  const pingInterval = setInterval(() => {
    const ws = get().ws;
    if (ws && ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        id: `heartbeat_${Date.now()}`,
        method: "getSlot"
      }));
    }
  }, 30000); // 30 seconds
  set({ pingInterval });
}
```

### Reconnection Logic
```typescript
_scheduleReconnect: (walletPublicKey: PublicKey) => {
  const maxAttempts = 5;
  const baseDelay = 1000;
  const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, state.reconnectAttempts); // Exponential backoff
  
  if (state.reconnectAttempts < maxAttempts) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      currentState._connectWebSocket(walletPublicKey);
    }, delay);
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Connection

1. **Monitor Console Logs**: Look for connection duration and close codes
2. **Use WebSocket Monitor**: Import and use the monitoring utility for detailed stats
3. **Check Network Tab**: Verify WebSocket connection in browser dev tools

## Common Close Codes
- **1000**: Normal closure (expected)
- **1001**: Going away (server/client leaving)
- **1006**: Abnormal closure (network issues)
- **1011**: Server error (RPC endpoint issues)

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working even with WebSocket issues
2. **Resource Cleanup**: All timers and intervals properly cleared
3. **Exponential Backoff**: Prevents overwhelming the server
4. **Heartbeat Strategy**: Keeps connections alive without being aggressive
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Makes debugging connection issues easier

## Next Steps

If you still experience connection issues:

1. Check the console logs for connection duration and close codes
2. Use the WebSocket monitor utility to track connection patterns
3. Consider switching to a different RPC endpoint if needed
4. Monitor network conditions and server availability

The improved implementation should now maintain stable WebSocket connections with automatic recovery from temporary network issues.
